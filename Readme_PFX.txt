By default, projects use a dummy PFX file. The default file is NOT
the ones that releases are signed with.  The production PFX file
is stored within the same path and is protected with an extremely
secure password.


In order to unlock the private key of the dummy PFX file, use
the password:

    "123123"  (without the quotes)
